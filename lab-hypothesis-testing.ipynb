    "Welcome to the Hypothesis Testing Lab, where we embark on an enlightening journey through the realm of statistical decision-making! In this laboratory, we delve into various scenarios, applying the powerful tools of hypothesis testing to scrutinize and interpret data.\n",
    "\n",
    "From testing the mean of a single sample (One Sample T-Test), to investigating differences between independent groups (Two Sample T-Test), and exploring relationships within dependent samples (Paired Sample T-Test), our exploration knows no bounds. Furthermore, we'll venture into the realm of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), unraveling the complexities of comparing means across multiple groups.\n",

    "So, grab your statistical tools, prepare your hypotheses, and let's embark on this fascinating journey of exploration and discovery in the world of hypothesis testing!"

    "For all six stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed), the p-values are significantly smaller than the significance level of 0.05.
